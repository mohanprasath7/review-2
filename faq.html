            <h3>What does pre-install mean?</h3>

            <h3>My Download is very slow?</h3>
            <p>The Download Speed is Influenced By: Your internet plan (for example a user’s 30 MB/s download speed can manage to download from non-premium UploadHaven servers at around 5 MB/s).The number off people using your modem.The servers the file is hosted on.The number of people trying to download the file at the same time. If you can, use a lan cable for downloading (direct connection from the router to your device) especially for bigger games. Downloading files on wifi can lead to the corruption of the file itself, making it unusable. This means when your wifi drops from X amount of seconds/minutes and it’s unable to resume the download when the internet is back on.</p>

          <div class="question">
            <h3>How do I download files via torrent? Is it safe?</h3>
            <p>As an alternative to normal UploadHaven downloads, We added torrent links for some of the larger and more popular games.Torrent links are added at the admin’s discretion and can’t be added for every game. Additionally, some games that now have a torrent link might lose it or be outdated when the game crack is updated and reuploaded to the site.It is illegal in some countries to use torrents. Make sure you check your countries rules regarding this before downloading any torrent file. If you can’t download files in your country, use a VPN and select a region where torrents are safe to use.</p>
